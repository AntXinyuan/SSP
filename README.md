## TL;DR
This repository contains the source code of [**Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition Guided Point-supervised Oriented Object Detection**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10601).

To tackle inadequate sample assignment and instance confusion in point-supervised oriented object detection for remote sensing dense scenes, we propose SSP (Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a framework integrating rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Its core innovations include pixel-level spatial partition for sample assignment and semantic-modulated box extraction for pseudo-label generation.
